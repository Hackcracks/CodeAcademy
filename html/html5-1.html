			Motherhood vs. career
		<p>
			One dynamic outlined by feminine psychologists is the balancing act that women partake in between the more traditional role of motherhood and the more modern one of a career woman. Balancing the roles means attempting to satisfy both the need for personal achievement and the need for love and emotional security.
			This does not mean that the roles contradict each other. The additional income from work may both relieve some stress and give the mother the ability to provide greater advantages (education, healthcare) to her children. Working also allows women to feel as though they are making a contribution to society beyond the family. A more fulfilled mother, in most cases, will be a better mother. Although this is true, many children do feel neglected by their mother’s when they are more focused on their career (Parker and Wang 2013).[1] It is normal for mothers to feel guilty when making changes to their child’s life. Twenty three percent of mothers feel that they are not spending enough time with their children, but they believe that their child will become more independent and understanding once they get older (Pew Research Center 2012).[1]
			A lot has changed throughout the years, mothers and fathers both feel the pressure of balancing both work and family life (Parker and Wang 2013).[1] Fifty six percent of mothers say that handling work and family life is difficult for them, this is because women are doing more than just housework and child care (Pew Research Center 2012).[1] The roles of moms and dads have changed. They are both trying to balance work and family (Parker and Wang 2013).[1] At the same time, society still believes that it is the mother’s role to spend more time with the children than the fathers (Parker and Wang 2013).[1] The Pew Research Center indicates how 42% of adults believe that the mother working part-time is ideal, 16% of adults believe that the mother working full-time is ideal, and one-third state how it would be best if the mother became a stay at home mom (Pew Research Center 2012).[1]
			In addition, fathers have always been viewed as the bread makers in the family. However, times have changed and they are now more included in the parenting role. Fathers spend more time at home and they engage in taking care of their children and helping around the house a lot more than they did have a century ago (Parker and Wang 2013).[1] For example, 50% of working fathers state that it is extremely difficult to balance work and taking care of their children (Pew Research Center 2012).[1] The Pew Research Center also asked parents to rate themselves as good or bad parents. It was found that most mothers rated themselves a lot higher than fathers did and working mothers rated themselves a lot higher than non-working mothers did (Pew Research Center 2012).[1]
			According to a study conducted by Dr. Jennifer Stuart, sometimes the history of the woman affects how she chooses to balance the two roles, or if she will balance at all. Specifically, Stuart asserts that the primary determinant is a woman's "quality of her relationship with her mother. Women whose mothers fostered feelings of both warm attachment and confident autonomy may find ways to enjoy their children and/or work, often modifying work and family environments in ways that favor both".[2]
			Some women have no choice other than to work while raising children because of financial need. Others work for personal fulfillment. In either case, women are making compromises in their careers so that they can balance paid work and motherhood responsibilities. They are cutting back hours and accepting lower pay or a lower job status. In order to make the compromise, they have chosen to be satisfied with being average rather than being a top performer in the workplace (Kapur, 2004).
			What mothers have to remember, according to Dr. Ramon Resa, is that "children are fairly resilient and will adapt to whatever changes are required. They are also astute at sensing unhappiness, disappointment and apathy" (Resa, 2009). There is no harm in trying any path in order to find fulfillment, because no decision is permanent and can be changed as the situation warrants.
